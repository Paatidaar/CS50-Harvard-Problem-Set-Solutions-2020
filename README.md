# CS50 2020
I've recently taken up the CS50 course up on edX. Here are my solutions to the Problem Sets that I've solved so far. I'll upload the rest as soon as I am done solving them (duh!) incase you don't find what you are looking for.

The psets were time consuming and challenging as expected but for a good reason. You must give your best before you refer to the solutions.

Notes
----------

- All codes in this repository have passed the make50 with a 100% so you don't have to worry about the code being inaccurate.
- You can still check the total score using " check50 " for code accuracy and " style50 " for code styling.
- Suggestions to make the code better are welcome!
